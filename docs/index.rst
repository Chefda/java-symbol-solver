The Java symbol solver
======================

This project permits to analyze Java source code for all sort of goals:
* find about method usages
* support automated refactoring of java code
* identify violation of best practices

More specifically the Java symbol solver permits you to resolve symbols in Java source code. It is intended to be used with JavaParser.
After JavaParser has produced an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a source file java-symbol-solver can be used to do
things like:

* find out to which definition a certain value refers to
* calculate the type of a certain expression
